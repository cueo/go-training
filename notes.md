## Getting Started

* Create a file with package main
* func main() is the starting point
* __go run filename__
* __go build filename__

* __go doc packagename__

### Rules

* Local variables need not be initialized. They get initialized to default values

* if condition does not require paranthesis
* if block needs curly braces
* else or else if block should start inline with if block
