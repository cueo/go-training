* Data and behaviour scattered all over
* Concepts that help you develop or build concurrent applications
* Docker, K8, Terraform

* Pointers in Go
* They are like references in Java
* You cannot perform arithmetic operations using pointers

* Lot of libraries for testing, benchmarking, profiling
* specialized libraries for concurrency, race detections

## Getting Started

* Create a file with package main
* func main() is the starting point
* __go run filename__
* __go build filename__

* __go doc packagename__

### Rules

* Local variables HAVE to be used
* Local variables need not be initialized. They get initialized to default values

* if condition does not require paranthesis
* if block needs curly braces
* else or else if block should start inline with if block

###

* Data types
* Variables, Constants
* for (range), if-else, switch-case
* Arrays
* Slices - make, copy, append
* Maps - make
